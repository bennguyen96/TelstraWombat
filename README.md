SWEN90009 Team Wombat

Introduction:  
-
At Telstra, large and varied data sets are used to detect security threats and anomalies. The data, generated from multiple technologies and vendors, come in different shapes and forms, as a result of different naming conventions, configurations, logging standards or simply different file formats. For example, with NGFW (next generation firewall data) there exists a number of vendors in this space (e.g. Palo Alto, Cisco, Fortinet, ...) with each having different log formats of similar data. Hence, before the data can be used for analysis, it must be normalized to extract common fields and convert data into a standard format. This process requires human effort to understand the logs and map them to common schema manually, which is not only time consuming but is also prone to human error. A more scientific and consistent approach to the problem is needed.



In this project, students will be researching, experimenting, designing and assessing different data normalization approaches that are used in the industry & research, subsequently designing and implementing a smart tool that automates or semi-automates the data extraction and normalization process.  

Product Description:
- 
Team Wombat created a tool that simplifies the process of normalising log data, by providing a UI that assists in the creation of regular expressions for unstructured files, suggesting column types for structured files and a central repository for these data normalisation efforts to reduce redudant work.
